I am a PhD Candidate in the Lindner College of Busienss at the University of Cincinnati

In my research, I study human-induced variability in service systems. I seek data-driven interventions which mitigate the negative consequences of this variability. To date, I have focused on two scenarios: (1) fair task allocation under variable employee preferences, and (2) real-time analytics for accommodating variation in the timing of customer demand. My interest in these topics is derived from the potential benefits to the individual well-being of both employees and customers.
