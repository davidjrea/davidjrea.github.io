\section{RESEARCH AREA}
\smallskip
My research focuses on translating data into decisions, including research questions on
\smallskip 
\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{0.5cm}(1)]
	\item the fair allocation of scarce resources
	\item capacity allocation under uncertain customer demand.
\end{enumerate}
Motivated by organizational partnerships, I have primarily focused on problems in healthcare and social welfare service systems.
